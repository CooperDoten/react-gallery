## REACT-GALLERY

_Duration_: Weekend Project




Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

For this project I built a react app that diplayed an image gallery.  Each image has a "love it" button that updates the amount of likes that it has. 

I componetized the Gallery-list, item and like div/button and made each picture hoverable, so the user knows that they can click it. On click the user can read a description of the image they are looking.
